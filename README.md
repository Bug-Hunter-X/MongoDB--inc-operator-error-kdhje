This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value.  However, in this example, we're attempting to increment the `age` field with a string value.  This leads to an error.  The solution shows the correct usage with a numeric value.
